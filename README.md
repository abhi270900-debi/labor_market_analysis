Labor Market Analysis: Registered Nurses (2022)

Overview

This project analyzes the demographic composition and wage structure of the Registered Nursing profession in the United States. Using 2022 microdata from the American Community Survey (ACS), we investigate patterns of racial representation and income disparities within the healthcare sector.

The goal of this research is to verify if standard labor market assumptions regarding racial wage gaps hold true in high-demand healthcare occupations.

Data Source:

Source: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey (ACS) 1-Year Estimates (2022).

Extraction Tool: Census Microdata Access Tool (MDAT).

Universe: Employed persons with Occupation Code 3255 (Registered Nurses).

Variables:

OCCP: Occupation (Filtered to 3255)

RAC1P: Recoded Detailed Race Code

WAGP: Wages or Salary Income (Past 12 Months)

Key Findings

Representation: The nursing workforce remains predominantly White (68.2%), though Black (11.6%) and Asian (9.3%) representation is significant compared to other professional sectors.

The "Reverse" Wage Gap: Analysis reveals that Asian Registered Nurses earn the highest average annual wage (~$82,600), significantly out-earning White nurses (~$60,900). Black nurses also show a wage premium over White nurses.

Interpretation: These disparities likely reflect geographic sorting, where minority nurses are disproportionately employed in high-cost-of-living urban centers (e.g., NYC, California) where nominal wages are higher.
